## Description of the app

Our app connects UCSC students to campus police, reports incidents or missing persons, with the touch of a button. Additionally, users can upload an image of who is missing/incidents or report dangerous behavioral situations (sexual assault). We also aim to make this a safe environment for users because we feel that if someone were to report someone for dishonorable/disruptive behavior, users are able to report or add additional information and comments anonymously to protect themselves for their safety. Our app also stores the history of incident reports. We have a page solely dedicated to missing persons so students, university staff, and the police can keep tabs on who they should look for.
